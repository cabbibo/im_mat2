# Fantasy Light

This Pack Contains two big features:

- Volumetric Light Rays
- Hit Light Points

They are doing it in a pretty naive / brute force manner, so especially if you are fill rate bound, be CAREFUL with how much overlap you use. However, I also think they give a much nicer stylized look than alot of the other solutions out there.

All of the materials are made from two shaders which I tried to comment, but if you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me on twitter: @cabbibo
